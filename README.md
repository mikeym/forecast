# Tiny Angular Starter Project

This is a small Angular seed project that includes a single Home view with a single
bound property. The project uses Bootstrap CSS for styling, and also includes Font
Awesome for icons. The UI Bootstrap Angular module is included as a convenience for
frequent projects, but plays no immediate role in the default project.

Simple tests exist for the main app routing and the home screen's controller.
